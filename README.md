# Analyzing-CMPD-Traffic-Stops
Analyzing CMPD Traffic Stops  For this problem set, we'll examine a data set of stops by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD).   Our focus will be to understand what factors are related to whether someone is searched or not for a traffic stop.  For our data set, you'll load the csv file we saved in the setup. This should be in your data folder.
