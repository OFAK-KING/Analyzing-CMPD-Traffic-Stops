# Analyzing-CMPD-Traffic-Stops
Analyzing CMPD Traffic Stops  For this problem set, we'll examine a data set of stops by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD).   Our focus will be to understand what factors are related to whether someone is searched or not for a traffic stop.  For our data set, you'll load the csv file we saved in the setup. This should be in your data folder.

Got the data from Professor Ryan of UNCC
